I'm a Research Associate in the Mathematical Department at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk). I am part of [The Mathematics of Waves and Materials Group](https://www.mwmresearchgroup.org), where I collaborate mainly with [Dr. Anastasia Kisil](https://anastasiakisil.weebly.com/) and [Dr. Raphael Assier](https://raphaelassier.weebly.com/).

I did my PhD in mathematical physics under the supervision of [DSc Andrey Shanin](https://acoustics.phys.msu.ru/teachers/shanin_files/~shanin/index.html) at the [Lomonosov Moscow State University](https://www.phys.msu.ru/eng/) where I received my degree in 2016. After that, I held a researcher position in the acoustic department from 2016-2023.

My Research interests include diffraction theory, complex Analysis in 1 and 2 dimensions, and computational acoustics.
